/* *************** STRUCTURAL ************************************** */
/* DO NOT change the order in which the strutural css appear on this
css because all others layer on top */

/* By default each product must call this css file in their pages. If they have additional styling unique to their
product they must also call that css file which is located in the corporate/css directory. The corporate css directory
should only be home to the unique style pages for each product. There is an additional signin_page.css that products
like webdms use. The signin_page is not called on this page. Each product that wants to access the signin_page needs to also include
that css file in their html page. 

The only css files that are not referenced on this page are:
.corporate.css itself
-the css used by the individual product that contains customization unique to them and these files are in the css subdirectory
-signin_page.css

note - we have to import mutliple pages instead of just having all the css listed here because IE won't read anything after 30
